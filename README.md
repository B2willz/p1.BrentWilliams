# Issues with Current Design and Reasoning:
   1. The button layout for the numbers is inconvenient. I find myself always cooking food in this microwave for about 1-3 minutes on the average case. The only times I use the         numbers *4-9* are when I am setting a timer on the microwave. Since I am using buttons *0-3* more often, I feel like the design would be better if the numbers on the button           layout were rearranged such that it would be like this instead. This way, the buttons I press more frequently are conveniently closer to the start button for this                 microwave.\
                              -----9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0----- \
                         Left <-----------------> Right
   2. Some of the buttons and their functions are not clear based off just looking at it. I feel that an effective UI can be understood by just looking at it. If I have to read a manfucatures manual on the UI to understand it, it is poorly designed. I have never used the "*Turntables*", "*Select*", "*Remote Enable*", "*Connect*", and the button that is three parallel horizontal lines since having this microwave. These buttons are just wasting space on the microwave UI.
   3. This microwave does not have an quick selection options for specific food items. I find myself cooking popcorn, pizza, and even sometimes hamburgers. I feel like having icon specific preset buttons could make the UI more user friendly. I like that this microwave is not cluttered with too many buttons, but there are no buttons that have icons for food, I always have to manually find how long to cook food items in this particular microwave.

# Common and Rare Use Cases:

Usually, I only cook food in this mircowave for about 1-2 minutes. On the start button, if a time is not selected, it defaults to a cook time of 30 seconds. You can press the start button while cooking to add an extra increment of 30 seconds. This makes it easy to just press the start button 2 times to cook something for a minute. Pressing the start button for 2-4 times is the most common use case personally for this microwave(*this is demostrated in the gif image*). More rare cases, when I am using another appliance like an oven, I use the microwave timer and set a time depending on how long something needs to be cooked in the oven. I would for sure say that the current interface makes doing the common things easier. I personally like that the UI does not have too many buttons, it has a sleek color scheme and an overall modest design.

# Common sequence of actions

For this microwave, the common sequence of actions is opening the microwave, placing the food in the microwave, close it, setting a cook time or the quick start mentioned above, then opening the microwave and taking the food out when it is done cooking.

# How does the microwave support the user figure out how to make it work?

I feel that the microwave suppots the user figure out how to start the microwave pretty well. The start button looks like a play button that you would see on youtube or on other major applications today. A lot of people have become more aware of technology so I feel like a mixture of placing the start button on the same right hand side where you open the microwave door along with the icon make it easy for anyone to use this microwave. While there are some buttons that do not make sense at first glance, the simple design of the UI makes this microwave approachable in my opinion.

# How does the microwave provide feedback to the user?

The microwave provides feedback by displaying the time on the digital recetangle above the number icons. The microwave also makes an alarm noise when the timer or cooking time has expired. Since a timer and a cooking time can be done simultaneously, the microwave has distinct noises for both. Sometimes, error messages can be generated in the digital rectangle as well, but that is more of a rare case.

# What are some common mistakes you can make with this current design?

One particular mistake that I usually find myself doing is setting the cooking time when I mean't to set a timer instead since the method of setting a time in general is almost an identical process. The timer button needs to be pressed first to set a timer but sometimes I forget to press it which starts the cooking instead. I feel that I forget to press the timer button since it is so far away from the start button in the UI button placement. Also there are other buttons to the left timer button, however they are incredibly hard to see unless the light button brightens the buttons with a backlight. These buttons are listed as 1-2 words such as "*Potato*" or "*Vegtables*". I personally never use this but the are way to difficult to see even during the daytime. I feel that if they also had images with other foods that were more commonly used and were easier to see, I would use them more often but I rarely ever notice that set of buttons on the far left of the UI. You can barely make them out in the images that I added above.
