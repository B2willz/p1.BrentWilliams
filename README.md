# Issues with current design and reasoning:
   1. The button layout for the numbers is inconvenient. I find myself always cooking food in this microwave for about 1-3 minutes on the average case. The only times I use the         numbers *4-9* are when I am setting a timer on the microwave. Since I am using buttons *0-3* more often, I feel like the design would be better if the numbers on the button           layout were rearranged such that it would be like this instead. This way, the buttons I press more frequently are conveniently closer to the start button for this                 microwave.\
                              -----9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0----- \
                         Left <-----------------> Right
   2. Some of the buttons and their functions are not clear based off just looking at it. I feel that an effective UI can be understood by just looking at it. If I have to read a manfucatures manual on the UI to understand it, it is poorly designed. I have never used the "Turntables", "Select", "Remote Enable", "Connect", and the button that is three parallel horizontal lines since having this microwave. 
   3. This microwave does not have an quick selection options for specific food items. I find myself cooking popcorn, pizza, and even sometimes hamburgers. I feel like having icon specific preset buttons could make the UI more user friendly. I like that this microwave is not cluttered with too many buttons, but there are no buttons that have icons for food, I always have to manually find how long to cook food items in this particular microwave.
